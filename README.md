### Udacity Nanodegree Program - Predictive Analytics for Business

The nanodegree program not only teaches the theoretical concepts of different predictive techniques, but also incorporates six scenario based projects which let you solve real business problems.

Following are my projects that I completed during the nanodegree program. 
The tools and technologies used for these projects were Tableau, Alteryx and MS Excel. I leveraged these tools to execute a vareity of statistical methodologies to perform different kinds of data analysis.

[Project 1: Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/SanaHusnani/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Udacity-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Predicting%20Diamond%20Prices.pdf)
